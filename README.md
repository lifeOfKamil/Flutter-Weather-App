## About The Project

<img src="oneplus_nighttime.png" alt="sunrise_mockup" width="1000">

Hi there! I'm Kamil Lepkowski, a passionate developer who developed this sleek, user-friendly weather using Flutter and Dart.

This app was initially inspired by my mobile development class where our final project required a dynamic application that stored data locally and utilized an API. Once the semester concluded, I decided to build out the app a bit more after sketching a new UI in Figma for it.

This project seamlessly integrates real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap providing dynamic UI components for today's weather and hourly and daily forecasts. With features such as location search and favorite location saving, I aimed to deliver an intuitive and informative weather experience.

Check out the code, explore the weather widgets, and enjoy the simplicity of checking the forecast with my Flutter Weather App!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.

## Built With

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications.
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/) - Programming language optimized for building mobile, desktop, server, and web applications.
- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) - API for accessing real-time weather data.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)
   <sub><sup>\* This project utilizes the student version of the API to access certain data<sub><sup>

2. Clone the repo

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/lifeOfKamil/Flutter-Weather-App.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory

```sh
    cd your-repo
```

4. Install dependencies

```sh
    flutter pub get
```

5. Enter your API key:

- Open the 'lib/services/weather_api.dart' file
- Replace 'const String apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';' with your actual API key.

6. Run the app

```sh
    flutter run
```

Feel free to reach out if you encounter any issues or have questions.
